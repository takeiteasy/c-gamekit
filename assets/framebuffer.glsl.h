    Overview:

        Shader program 'framebuffer_program':
            Get shader desc: framebuffer_program_shader_desc(sg_query_backend());
            Vertex shader: framebuffer_vs
                Attribute slots:
                    ATTR_framebuffer_vs_position = 0
                    ATTR_framebuffer_vs_texcoord = 1
            Fragment shader: framebuffer_fs
                Image 'tex':
                    Type: SG_IMAGETYPE_2D
                    Component Type: SG_SAMPLERTYPE_FLOAT
                    Bind slot: SLOT_tex = 0


    Shader descriptor structs:

        sg_shader framebuffer_program = sg_make_shader(framebuffer_program_shader_desc(sg_query_backend()));

    Vertex attribute locations for vertex shader 'framebuffer_vs':

        sg_pipeline pip = sg_make_pipeline(&(sg_pipeline_desc){
            .layout = {
                .attrs = {
                    [ATTR_framebuffer_vs_position] = { ... },
                    [ATTR_framebuffer_vs_texcoord] = { ... },
                },
            },
            ...});

    Image bind slots, use as index in sg_bindings.vs_images[] or .fs_images[]

        SLOT_tex = 0;
